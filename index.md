   - La Distinction?
      - Hippocampus
         - 0.01% Difference from Other Humans
         - But gave *Sapiens* an overwhelming edge 
      - Thus
         - We have Harold Bloom
         - Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human
         - But which human??
            - Poor fella missed the mark
         - Our fork belongs here

#### 🤖
- [Update](https://github.com/ukb-pyro/msnd/blob/sawubona-ngikhona/flow/cltx/sim.md) (implied dynamism in Raphael)
   - Heraclitus is front-and-center in School of Athens
      - Parmenedes has no place in Raphael's world 
   - But everyone only sees Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates
   - Raphael is a master of space, perspectivism, and rhythm 
- Greco, Judaic -> Chistian (-GJc)
- Athena, Solomon -> Madonnas (r)
#### 🌊 
   - My chat with GPT looped in the Reticular Formation
   - So lets investigate it
   - Placeholder for Shakespeare's entire body of work
   - Of interest is how he selected his 38 topics
#### ❤️ 
   - Lets call it Don Giovani's impulsivity
   - But that would be low bandwidth, low context length
   - Das ist Mozart
      - So context length is long
      - And maybe high bandwidth?
      - We then get a sort of solipsism
      - Just not quite there 
#### 🔁 
   - A twin with high bandwidth makes it the spur of a moment, riding a photon, to the "ends" of the galaxy
   - His brooding fellow twin attempting to digest the entire context of the cosmos is, obviously, firmly still on earth
   - Emergent perspectivism here is the key, always emerging from simulation
   - Dull, unimaginative scientists insist on the data
   - They'd never produce the ghost in Hamlet!
#### 🎭 
   - Splicing, recombination, scaling
   - ChatGPT more than any other ai caught our attension
   - While scaling is mostly grammar, Ukubona LLC emphasizes prosodic scaling
   - Spatial-Temporal scaling is the most powerful way to perspectivism

## ♾️ Sonata, [07/18/2025-07/19/2025](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1514/1514-h/1514-h.htm)
- With the Ghost, Shakespeare was able to transcend the constraints of the omubanaboneza (the original systems engineer)
- Recursion then ceases to be repetition, but rather development and, presto, recapituation
