- Update (implied dynamism in Raphael)
   - Heraclitus is front-and-center in School of Athens
      - Parmenedes has no place in Raphael's world 
   - But everyone only sees Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates
   - Raphael is a master of space, perspectivism, and rhythm 
- Greco, Judaic -> Chistian (-GJc)
- Athena, Solomon -> Madonnas (r)

- Recursion then ceases to be repetition, but rather development and, presto, recapituation
